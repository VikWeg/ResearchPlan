Summary max 0.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The personalization of medicine is strongly driven by recent advancements
 of information technology.
 The quality and amount of data that is available nowadays makes it possible
 to work towards optimized therapy in the sense that it is tailored to the
 individual patient.
 However, the increase in data complexity and quantity can not be handled
 only by doctors anymore, serious technological efforts are required to
 develop intelligent, computational solutions.
 One field of particular interest in this context is Neuroimaging which
 has experienced significant progress with the advent of Magnetic Resonance
 Imaging (MRI).
 This technique enables high-throughput imaging of the entire brain at a
 macroscopic length scale with a rich variety of modalities providing structural
 and functional information.
 Our goal is to build systems that automatically leverage the information
 contained in MRI data to robustly answer clinically relevant questions
 such as the identification of subtypes in spectrum disorders or the prediction
 of individual risk of disease.
 Our contribution consists of introducing machine learning methods to problems
 of real interest in Neuroimaging with potential impact on the therapy of
 neurological diseases.
 This includes the systematic application and evaluation of algorithms as
 well as their efficient and usable implementation to meet practical needs.

Introduction min 0.5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In these days digitalization of information is reaching out to all domains
 fundamentally affecting the way data is acquired, stored and processed.
 This evolution is especially exemplified by medicine which has been transformin
g from a knowledge-intensive science to a data-intensive science 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "knowledge/data intensity"

\end_inset

.
 Particularly many opportunities that come with this transition are present
 in the area of radiology that comprises key technologies such as magnetic
 resonance imaging (MRI) which is applied broadly in practice, because it
 enables non-invasive and non-radiative imaging of the internal structure
 of sensitive organs such as the brain.
 This provides a direct handle to the source of many neurological diseases
 which in the past could only be investigated via secondary symptoms.
 The vision is that these specific markers enable individualized diagnosis
 leading to therapies tailored to each person's phenotype - a goal which
 becomes even more significant in the face of an ever aging society.
 The longer average life expectancy results in the proliferation of neurological
 spectrum disorders, i.e.
 such that do not have one typical disease manifestation but rather a distributi
on of individual manifestations.
 However, the increase in information content also comes at the cost of
 increased data complexity which poses serious challenges to its analysis.
 It is not only the number of brain images that can go into the hundreds
 if not thousands for a given study which makes analysis difficult for trained
 humans, but also the non-intuitive topology of volumetric tensor images.
 Consequently, learning multivariate disease patterns from MRI images calls
 for intelligent computational methods.
 The main challenge is the extraction of informative and yet robust features
 in a setting where the dimensionality of the input data (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

100k) is high compared to the number of typically available samples (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

100-1k).
 We tackle this problem by building probabilistic models that take into
 account knowledge about the data in order to engineer good features, but
 as to date it is not clear how diseases really express themselves as global
 patterns in brain images, the ultimate goal remains to develop data-driven,
 automatic feature learning approaches.
 Once a model is specified on paper, the problem of finding the right parameters
 follows.
 This is typically computationally very demanding necessitating the use
 of optimized code and special purpose hardware to speed up the learning.
 In order to eventually utilize our systems in a clinical environment we
 will have to provide a servicable interface for end users such as doctors
 or neuroscientists.

Goals of the Thesis min 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Adaptive Global Tractography
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our current model the support point density is fixed heuristically.
 It has turned out in our experiments that this can lead to negative frustration
 effects if an inappropriate number of support points is initially placed.
 Introducing a proper model that adaptively adjusts the local number of
 support points is expected to improve the reconstruction performance considerab
ly.
 On the other hand, this means that the model might change its size during
 optimization which poses new implementation challenges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Extensions Global Tractography
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many possible extensions and refinements to our current tractography
 approach.
 The most promising to incorporate are the use of multimodal orientation
 distribution functions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ODF"

\end_inset

 instead of the diffusion tensor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DiffTensor"

\end_inset

, multiscale methods, the use of regional priors for e.g.
 curvature or higher order potentials in the energy function (e.g.
 fiber torsion).
 Additionally, we will explore which optimization techniques deliver the
 best performance.
 Among possible candidates to be compared are variational methods, belief
 propagation, tensor decomposition, gradient descent for the support point
 position updates and improved sampling with multi-edge moves (see e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Frindel: Global Tractography"

\end_inset

) and parallel tempering.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Clustering of brain networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have closely followed the approach shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Graph clustering: Schr√∂dinger Operator"

\end_inset

.
 However, from a learning perspective there are several possible extensions
 to make the embedding more flexible.
 This includes the addition of higher order derivatives with learnable coefficie
nts, turning the initial conditions into tunable parameters in a classification
 setting and manipulation of the LaPlacian matrix (e.g.
 powers, SVD,...).
 Apart from the methodological work, we will evaluate the performance of
 the original and extended approach on real brain networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differential operator approach to graph embedding is quite particular,
 so that we will also consider more general neural network methods which
 learn the representation directly from the data (such as autoencoders or
 Restricted Boltzmann Machines, in combination with convolutional network
 layouts).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Dementia Prediction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having established first baselines, we aim to apply a more sophisticated
 deep learning model.
 Due to the image nature of our input we will use a convolutional architecture
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ConvNets"

\end_inset

 which has seen great success in image classification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Deep Conv nets Image Net"

\end_inset

.
 So far the great majority of applications thereof involve two-dimensional
 images, whereas our contribution will take into account the three-dimensional
 topology of MRI images.
 In order to deal with the restricted number of available samples it will
 be necessary to incorporate and test different regularization techniques
 such as (structured) sparsity penalties, contractive penalties, label preservin
g transformations, dropout, unsupervised pretraining, etc.
 This way we hope to develop an automatic diagnosis tool that involves as
 little human processing as possible.
 Another aspect is the availability of several MRI 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

channels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e.
 different imaging modalities applied to the same patient.
 We will investigate how multiple views can be combined beneficially in
 the deep learning framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Performance Computing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Achieving the above goals and their practical deployment requires efficient
 software implementation and the use of special purpose hardware.
 We want to take this into account when building our systems, especially
 also for the reason that there are excellent computing ressources available.
 Our global tractography solution will run on the Brutus/Euler compute clusters
 of ETH Zurich using customized MPI code.
 In the short term, our group will acquire a small GPU cluster which we
 plan to make use of for our deep learning solutions.
 Apart from exploiting tools from performance computing for machine learning
 applications in MRI analysis we also want to enhance our group's practical
 expertise in implementing algorithms on state-of-the-art hardware.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Global Tractography
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have developed a flexible Markov Random Field model for automatic global
 tractography.
 It takes into account how well connections are aligned with the data, incorpora
tes penalties on the fiber curvature and a prior on the fiber topology.
 It can resolve difficult fiber geometries such as crossings, even from
 simple unimodal diffusion tensor data.
 Extensions that enable adaptive placement of support points are being developed.
 For optimization we implemented and fine-tuned an annealed Gibbs sampling
 procedure.
 The results of the tracking are exported in the .trk format which can be
 used by third party visualization applications.
 For performance reasons the code was written in the C language and optimized
 appropriately.
 This way the single-threaded runtime is no more than a few hours (up to
 2-3x less for common multithread cores).
 We also experimented with a GPU implementation in CUDA, but found that
 the problem was too irregular in the sense that control flow and memory
 access are data-dependent so that an efficient GPU implementation is very
 hard.
 For this reason an MPI-based cluster solution was built that achieves up
 to 30x speedup compared to a single thread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Embedding & clustering of graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are performing clustering on brain images by using the results of tractograph
y.
 In order to do that we embed each brain network using an approach based
 on the trace of differential operators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Graph clustering: Schr√∂dinger Operator"

\end_inset

.
 This trace is a vector with much lower dimension than the original brain
 image but it preserves information about the topology of the underlying
 graph, that is fiber connections.
 The idea is that the global brain white matter network changes in response
 to neurological diseases - current experiments are to show if this approach
 is sensitive enough to differentiate between different subtypes of e.g.
 Parkinson disease.
 First tests on synthetic graph data showed that it is possible to make
 distinctions between graph topologies (e.g.
 Random graph vs.
 Scale free graph) but also inside a certain topology (e.g.
 Random graphs with different p values).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dementia Prediction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have established first baselines for the classification of elderly people
 into cognitively stable vs.
 progressive from their T1 structural MRI scans only.
 For this we applied classical machine learning approaches such as a combination
 of Fisher score and SVM, SpaceNet 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SpaceNet"

\end_inset

 or LeCun's LeNet on PCA reduced brain images.
 All these approaches manage well on the discrimination of male vs.
 female, but perform poorly on the stable vs.
 progressive.
 The main reasons are the subtlety of the group difference, the comparatively
 low sensitivity of T1 measurements and the risk of overfitting.
 Consequently, we are considering other MRI modalities (dMRI, ASL, fMRI,
 SW) and their combinations and incorporating regularization techniques
 used in the context of deep learning.
\begin_inset Newline newline

A different approach based on stacked generalization
