\begin_layout Standard
The personalization of medicine is strongly driven by recent advancements
 of information technology.
 The quality and amount of data that is available nowadays makes it possible
 to work towards optimized therapy in the sense that it is tailored to the
 individual patient.
 However, the increase in data complexity and quantity can not be handled
 only by doctors anymore, serious technological efforts are required to
 develop intelligent, computational solutions.
 One field of particular interest in this context is Neuroimaging which
 has experienced significant progress with the advent of Magnetic Resonance
 Imaging (MRI).
 This technique enables high-throughput imaging of the entire brain at a
 macroscopic length scale with a rich variety of modalities providing structural
 and functional information.
 Our goal is to build systems that automatically leverage the information
 contained in MRI data to robustly answer clinically relevant questions
 such as the identification of subtypes in spectrum disorders or the prediction
 of individual risk of disease.
 Our contribution consists of introducing machine learning methods to problems
 of real interest in Neuroimaging with potential impact on the therapy of
 neurological diseases.
 This includes the systematic application and evaluation of algorithms as
 well as their efficient and usable implementation to meet practical needs.

In these days digitalization of information is reaching out to all domains
 fundamentally affecting the way data is acquired, stored and processed.
 This evolution is especially exemplified by medicine which has been transformin
g from a knowledge-intensive science to a data-intensive science

\end_inset

.
 Particularly many opportunities that come with this transition are present
 in the area of radiology that comprises key technologies such as magnetic
 resonance imaging (MRI) which is applied broadly in practice, because it
 enables non-invasive and non-radiative imaging of the internal structure
 of sensitive organs such as the brain.
 This provides a direct handle to the source of many neurological diseases
 which in the past could only be investigated via secondary symptoms.
 The vision is that these specific markers enable individualized diagnosis
 leading to therapies tailored to each person's phenotype - a goal which
 becomes even more significant in the face of an ever aging society.
 The longer average life expectancy results in the proliferation of neurological
 spectrum disorders, i.e.
 such that do not have one typical disease manifestation but rather a distributi
on of individual manifestations.
 However, the increase in information content also comes at the cost of
 increased data complexity which poses serious challenges to its analysis.
 It is not only the number of brain images that can go into the hundreds
 if not thousands for a given study which makes analysis difficult for trained
 humans, but also the non-intuitive topology of volumetric tensor images.
 Consequently, learning multivariate disease patterns from MRI images calls
 for intelligent computational methods.
 The main challenge is the extraction of informative and yet robust features
 in a setting where the dimensionality of the input data (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

100k) is high compared to the number of typically available samples (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

100-1k).
 We tackle this problem by building probabilistic models that take into
 account knowledge about the data in order to engineer good features, but
 as to date it is not clear how diseases really express themselves as global
 patterns in brain images, the ultimate goal remains to develop data-driven,
 automatic feature learning approaches.
 Once a model is specified on paper, the problem of finding the right parameters
 follows.
 This is typically computationally very demanding necessitating the use
 of optimized code and special purpose hardware to speed up the learning.
 In order to eventually utilize our systems in a clinical environment we
 will have to provide a servicable interface for end users such as doctors
 or neuroscientists.
